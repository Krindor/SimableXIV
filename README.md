# SimableXIV [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Krindor/SimableXIV.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Krindor/SimableXIV)
SimableXIV is a Final Fantasy XIV Simulation Library intented to be used as a tool to assist players in testing out rotations, gear, openers etc and also for theorycrafting. While the sim is built for FFXIV a lot of the classes and methods should be reusable for other games with slight changes to accomodate the differences. 
 
## Parts needed for the basic application
* Finish the change of time and functions related to it
* Adding effects to buffs
* Putting potency, buffs and damage formulas together
* Logging damage, buffs dropping off/being added
* Stuff I've probably missed

## Planned Additions Main Library(No specific order)
* Jobs will be added with the help of others in no specific order
* Simulating a party
* Proper simulation with probability and a large amount of iterations
* Application of machine learning
* More things I've probably forgotten at the time of writing
## Planned Additions GUI
* GUI for the simulation
* GUI to tweak rotation logic
* Representation of data in graphs and other statistical tools (Mostly for probability simulation)
